The reach of social media platforms and its
usage has increased many folds in the recent
years. Social networks have become one of the
most popular platforms to share one’s ideas,
opinions and reactions with the other users.
This leads to easy access of peoples’ opinions and sentiments towards many issues and
events occurring around us. One such event
is Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this
project, we try to categorise public sentiments
associated with the pandemic by collecting
tweets regarding COVID-19 based on some
specific hashtags, by making use of Twitter
API and analyze the fetched tweets using NLP
tools and techniques. We have used Twarc library and Naive Bayes classifier for carrying
out the sentiment analysis operation. The results obtained after analysing are being shown
in the form of graphical representation.
